      <h3>Almshouses</h3>

      <h4>Accomodation</h4>

      <p>
      The Almshouses referred to is a pair of cottages known as HoChee Cottages in Dormansland and we have just recently carried out extensive refurbishment and extension works to these properties. There are currently residents in both cottages.

      <h4>History and Background - HoChee Cottages</h4>

      <p>
        Lingfield United Trust (Formerly Lingfield United Charities) in 2013, commenced

and completed the extension and refurbishment of its two alms houses in Plough

Road, Dormansland, known as HoChee Cottages. The Trust is responsible for the

management and maintenance of these properties and had been planning to

upgrade and enlarge the accommodation for some time.

Built around 1870 and extended in the 1920s, the cottages were in need of

extensive renovation to provide comfortable and energy efficient accommodation

appropriate to modern standards. Thanks to a generous grant from the Nancy

McIver Trust, this work was made possible and building work commenced in

March 2013.
</p>
<p>

The cottages were completed and handed over to the Trust by the builders, on the

19th July 2013.

The result is stunning both outside and internally. Each of the two cottages has

been extended to the rear and reorganised inside, to provide a larger sitting room,

bedroom and kitchen. The new wet rooms are compliant with disability standards

as recommended for alms house accommodation. Their charming outside

appearance is retained, with the extension work restricted to the rear in an attractive

design.

      <h4>Why the name HoChee Cottages?</h4>

<p>
      Ho Chee to whom the two cottages are dedicated, was born in 1789 at Hyan-Shan

in Canton, China (now known as Guangzhou in the province of Guangdong). He

was the son of Ho Foo, a mandarin. It is likely that Ho Chee worked with or for

the East India Company (EIC) in Canton and Macao and had an official

Government sponsored post.

<p>

Ho Chee, who amended his name to John Hochee, (known as HoChee on the

cottages) formed an enduring friendship with a John Fullerton Elphinstone

sometime after 1830. Elphinstone was born in 1778, the eldest son of William

Elphinstone a Director of the East India Company. He went to Canton in 1794

where he was employed by the Company as a 'Writer' (or clerk). He continued to

serve the Company until his retirement on the 18th March 1818. In August 1819

John Hochee arrived from Canton to live in Elphinstone’s household in England

and from then on Hochee assumed complete administrative responsibility for

Elphinstone’s estate. Hochee married Charlotte Mole in the Parish Church at

Braughing, Hertfordshire in 1823. John and Charlotte had eight children, all but

one born in Lingfield and baptised in the Parish Church.

</p>
<p>
Hochee’s estate was considerable, as a result of his inheritance under Elphinstone’s

will; John Hochee died in Brighton on 1st March 1860 and was buried there in the

plot next to his patron and benefactor. Shortly after Hochee’s death, his widow

Charlotte built a double cottage on land which was inherited from John

Elphinstone, situated at the cross roads at Dormansland; a small piece of land

formerly planted with fir and anciently the site of a lime kiln. In May 1874 the

cottages were given by Trust Deed to the Vicar and Churchwardens of Lingfield,

with an endowment of £50 and were to be known as The HoChee Almshouses, in

memory of her late husband. A bust of Hochee stands on a plinth in the hallway, a

constant reminder of John Hochee’s life in the village.

<p>
  Lingfield United Charities (reg no 200264) took over and managed the cottages

in 1953, and in 2013 the Almshouses became the responsibility of Lingfield

United Trust (reg no 1150971).
